### DATE:   10-10-2024                                                                         
### REGISTER NUMBER : 212222060012
### AIM: 
To find the sequence of plan for Monkey Banana problem using PDDL Editor.
###  Algorithm:
Step 1:  Start the program <br> 
Step 2 : Create a domain for Monkey Banana Problem. <br> 
Step 3:  Create a domain by specifying predicates. <br> 
Step 4: Specify the actions GOTO, CLIMB, PUSH-BOX, GET-KNIFE, GRAB-BANANAS in Monkey Banana problem.<br>  
Step 5:   Define a problem for Monkey Banana problem.<br> 
Step 6:  Obtain the plan for given problem.<br> 
Step 7: Stop the program.<br> 


(define (domain monkey)	    <br>

                                 (at bananas ?y) (onbox ?y))<br>
	     :effect (hasbananas))<br>
  ;; getting water<br>
  (:action PICKGLASS<br>
	     :parameters (?y)<br>
	     :precondition (and (location ?y) (at glass ?y) (at monkey ?y))<br>
	     :effect (and (hasglass) (not (at glass ?y))))<br>
  (:action GETWATER<br>
	     :parameters (?y)<br>
	     :precondition (and (location ?y) (hasglass)<br>
				 (at waterfountain ?y)<br>
				 (at monkey ?y)<br>
				 (onbox ?y))<br>
	     :effect (haswater)))<br>
```

### Input :
```
(define (problem pb1)<br>
    	(:domain monkey)<br>
  	(:objects p1 p2 p3 p4 bananas monkey box knife)<br>
  	(:init (location p1)<br>
		(location p2)<br>
		(location p3)<br>
		(location p4)<br>
	 	(at monkey p1)<br>
		(on-floor)<br>
		(at box p2)<br>
		(at bananas p3)<br>
	 	(at knife p4)<br>
	)<br>
  	(:goal (and (hasbananas)))<br>
)<br>
